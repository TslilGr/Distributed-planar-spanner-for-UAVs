# Distributed-planar-spanner-for-UAVs

About The Project

The project is collaboration between our department and RAFAEL which is Israeli defense technology company. This is a continues project.
 Our part of this project,
included design and implementation of network architecture with Omnet++ simulation framework based on C++ programming. Implementation of new Distributed planar spanner for UAVs sensors, to obtain a connected sparse self-stabilizing graph that can be maintained using only the local information between neighboring nodes.
we built a new distributed algorithm that improve the communication between UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicle) swarm, to control center which are located far away from all UAV's. The purpose of the algorithm is to get into an optimal state, so that the number of links (edges) is minimized and still avoid congestions in the network. Congestion is defined by several parameters, each one of them have different impotence and therefore receive different weight, and the edge weight will be the calculation of total variables.

The Work

The main changes in the code are in the files: 
1.  MYIdealAirFrame 
2.  MYConstSpeedMobilityDrone 
3.  MYIdealRadio 
4.  MYIdealChannelModelAccess
5.  MYIdealChannelModel 

As part of our work we modified existing code parts, and fixed bugs that we received from previous years. Those changes are not included in the list above.
